# Monte Sión Center – React Remodel

This is a React + Vite + Tailwind starter for a redesigned Monte Sión Center website.
It includes basic pages (Home, Mission, Programs, Donate, Contact, News) and a simple layout
with navigation, footer, and a Google Maps embed on the contact page.

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** (LTS) installed.
2. Unzip this project.
3. In a terminal, `cd` into the project folder (where `package.json` is).
4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open the URL that appears in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

From there, you can edit the text on each page to match the current Monte Sión Center site,
replace the placeholder content, and tune the design as needed.
